# Cloud Orchestration Code Project
Feel free to use any language you are most comfortable with. If you can use golang that would be great but not required. \
[Golang](https://go.dev)\
Below is a great tutorial and is simple\
[Golang Tutorial](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)

This is just a simple way for me to see if you understand some of the technologies we use on our team.
 



## Steps
1. Create a github project 
2. Create a simple Golang web service
3. The golang web service will have an endpoint that you will make up on your own and when requested will return "Hello World" for the response.
4. After you have created a web service use a Dockerfile to dockerize this service and map a port so when the docker image is pulled down and run it can be opened up in the browser using the localhost://{portNumber}. You can decide what port number to use. 
5. Push it to github and let me know the url and I will run it.
